# Self Management App

This site helps consumers break a large project into tasks with start times that can soft push the project deadline if a task is not completed.
This siteâ€™s main motivation comes from our time management challenges. Being able to create an application that can break a project into smaller tasks can provide a consumer with a more realistic timeline of their goal.

## USER STORY
